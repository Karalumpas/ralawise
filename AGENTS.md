# Repository Guidelines for Codex Agents

This project is a small Node.js Express application for processing WooCommerce
CSV exports. When updating or adding code, keep these rules in mind:

* Use CommonJS syntax as shown in `server.js`.
* Do not remove the sample ZIP files located in `public/samples/`.
* Before committing your changes, run `npm test` to ensure the repository's test
  script completes (it currently prints a message only).
* After testing, commit directly to the main branch.
